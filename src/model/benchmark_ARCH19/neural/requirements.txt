Initialization

    u_ts = 0.001;

Inputs:

    Piecewise constant input signal with 3 segments
        1 <= Ref and Ref <= 3

Requirement:
    There are two parameters alpha=0.005 beta=0.03

    □_[1.0, 18.0] (!((alpha + (beta * abs(Ref))) <= abs((Pos - Ref))) ==> ◇_[0.0, 2.0] □_[0.0, 1.0] ((alpha + (beta * abs(Ref))) <= abs((Pos - Ref))))

Alternative definition
    # Output is close to the reference signal
    param alpha=0.005
    param beta=0.04
    param beta=0.03 # respectively
    close_ref := abs(Pos[t] - Ref[t]) <= alpha+ beta*abs(Ref[t])
    reach_ref_in_tau := ev_[0, 2] (alw_[0, 1] (close_ref))

    # At all times, Output will be close to the reference signal in tau seconds
    NN: alw_[0, t_end-tau] ((not close_ref) => reach_ref_in_tau)

Potentially more difficult values (open to debate)
    beta \in {0.03,0.04} or alpha \in {0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007}
